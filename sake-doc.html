<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<a name="What-is-it_003f"></a>
<h3 class="section">1.1 What is it?</h3>
<p>Sake is a way to easily design, share, build, and visualize workflows with
intricate interdependencies. Sake is self-documenting because the
instructions for building a project also serve as the documentation of the
project&rsquo;s workflow. The first time it&rsquo;s run, sake will build all of the
components of a project in an order that automatically satisfies all
dependencies. For all subsequent runs, sake will only rebuild the parts
of the project that depend on changed files. This cuts down on unnecessary
re-building and lets the user concentrate on their work rather than memorizing
the order in which commands have to be run.
</p>
<p>Sake is free, open source cross-platform software under a very permissive
license (MIT Expat) and is written in Python.
</p>
<a name="Who-is-it-for_003f"></a>
<h3 class="section">1.2 Who is it for?</h3>
<p>Sake&rsquo;s insistence on clean formatting, explicit statement of intentions,
capacity for visualization, ability to work on various platforms, and
ability to rebuild only what is needed make it a great choice for
</p><ul>
<li> Scientists that want to share their scientific workflow  with other
researchers. Sake helps facilitate open science and reproducibility.
</li><li> Data analysts with steps in their pipeline that take hours or days to
finish running.
</li><li> Business teams that want to share and visualize workflows amongst its
members, even if they are using different computing platforms.
</li></ul>

<a name="Nomenclature"></a>
<h3 class="section">1.3 Nomenclature</h3>
<p>To avoid confusion, it would be helpful to expound on some of the terms
that this documentation will be using.
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>workflow</code></dt>
<dd><p>a series of steps performed in a particular order to complete a piece of work.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>scientific workflow</code></dt>
<dd><p>a specific type of workflow where many or all of the steps are performed
by computers. This is a growing trend in science. Data science,
bioinformatics, cognitive science, and computational linguistics,
in particular, make heavy use of this paradigm.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>pipeline</code></dt>
<dd><p>Another name for a workflow, especially one whose steps produce outputs
that are fed, as input, into subsequent steps.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>dependency</code></dt>
<dd><p>An input or step that is required for another step to execute is said to
be a <code>dependency</code> of the later step.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>graph</code></dt>
<dd><p>a construct in mathematics that represents a set of objects (called &rsquo;nodes&rsquo;
or &rsquo;vertices&rsquo;) and the connections between them (called &rsquo;links&rsquo; or &rsquo;edges&rsquo;)
</p></dd>
<dt><code>directed graph</code></dt>
<dd><p>A type of graph whose connections are unidirectional and can be visually
represented as arrows.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>directed acyclic graph</code></dt>
<dd><p>A type of directed graph that does not contain any loops or cycles. A
directed graph has the property of having at least one ordering of nodes
such that no node in the ordering &rsquo;points to&rsquo; a node earlier in the ordering.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>dependency graph</code></dt>
<dd><p>If the nodes of a directed acyclic graph are viewed as steps in a workflow
or pipeline, and the directional links are viewed as outputs that become
another step&rsquo;s input, this construct of mathematics is an abstraction of a
workflow that can be run in an order that satisfies all dependencies.
A visual representation of a dependency graph is an easy and intuitive way
to view a workflow and the steps involved.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>YAML</code></dt>
<dd><p>A data serialization format that is extremely easy to read.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>Sakefile</code></dt>
<dd><p>A file written in a subset of YAML that describes a workflow. This is read and
can be executed or visualized by <code>sake</code>.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>target</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is the abstraction of a step in a workflow used by the <code>sakefile</code>.
A <code>sakefile</code> is made of one or more targets. This name is borrowed
from the <code>make</code> software.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>build</code></dt>
<dd><p>(Used as a verb). The execution of the commands of a step. A whole project
can be built, or just a specific step. The &rsquo;build&rsquo; can be the execution
of a script, the execution of arbitrary shell commands, the removal of
intermediate files, the compilation of source files, etc...  A build can
take microseconds or days to complete.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="Differences-from-GNU-Make-or-other-make-software"></a>
<h3 class="section">1.4 Differences from GNU Make or other <code>make</code> software</h3>
<p>The ideas behind <code>sake</code> and <code>sakefiles</code> are borrowed heavily
from <code>make</code> software, which is used primarily to build executables
from various source files. A <code>makefile</code> can, more generally, be used
to describe a process that brings one or more source files to some
&rsquo;completed&rsquo; state. Probably nothing is better than <code>make</code> to compile
executables, but there are several reasons why using <code>sake</code> may be
a better choice for some tasks.
</p><ul>
<li> As a consequence of being so powerful for source code compilation,
<code>Makefiles</code> can sometimes be very hard to read and write, particularly
to the unfamiliar.
</li><li> Most <code>make</code> software assumes that if the timestamp of a file changes,
than all subsequent steps that depend on that file need to be run in order
to remain up-to-date. In many cases, though, the time-stamp of a file
can change but the contents remain the same and, thus, a rebuild isn&rsquo;t
necessary.
</li><li> The syntax of <code>makefiles</code> makes it difficult to intuit the flow of a
pipeline. Additionally, outside tools have to be used in order to visualize
the flow.
</li><li> Steps like displaying help and cleaning intermediate files are not handled
automatically by <code>make</code> and are prone to errors.
</li></ul>
<p><code>Sake</code> seeks to rectify these limitations of <code>make</code>. To wit,
</p><ul>
<li> Sakefiles are written in a very easy-to-read-and-write markup language.
</li><li> <code>Sake</code> was also not designed with a particular application in mind, so
the use of <code>sake</code> is just as applicable to one domain as it is to
another. This cuts down on the number of tools a user must learn to do
certain specialized tasks.
</li><li> Originally borne out of the frustration of rebuilding targets whenever
a timestamp of a file changes and, therefore, being difficult to use
for data analysis with very long time-consuming analytics, <code>sake</code>
actually <em>reads</em> the file to determine if a re-building is really
necessary.
</li><li> The clean nature of the <code>sakefile</code> makes it much easier to intuit
the flow of a pipeline. Additionally, a visualization mechanism is built
right in which produces an image of the dependency graph that is easy to
study, to share, and is aesthetically pleasing.
</li><li> Sake handles some &rsquo;administrative&rsquo; tasks for the user. This cuts down
on hard-to-track-down errors.
</li></ul>
<p>Perhaps the most fundamental difference between <code>sake</code> and the
<code>make</code> system is that <code>sake</code> seeks not only to be a system that
builds a project from start to completion (or part of a project) resolving all
dependencies along the way; <code>sake</code> seeks to simultaneously
<em>document</em> the project.
</p>
<p>There are some more technical differences between the two systems that may
confuse a user that is familiar with <code>make</code>. For example, all &rsquo;targets&rsquo;
in a <code>sakefile</code> are what GNU Make considers &rsquo;phony&rsquo; targets. Targets
in <code>sakefiles</code> are not filenames, but instead more human-readable
short descriptions of the step.
Other differences will become clearer later in the document.

<a name="Installation-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">2 Installation</h2>
<p>Here we will go over obtaining the <code>sake</code> software, go over generic
installation instructions, and discuss detailed installation instructions
for various platforms.
</p>
<p><strong>Note: Some of the commands in this section may require root or
administrator privileges depending on your system</strong>
</p>
<a name="Getting-Sake"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.1 Getting Sake</h3>
<p>Since sake is a set of python modules and a python driver, there are no
binary executables that can be downloaded.
Although, in most cases, <em>manually</em> obtaining the source code for sake
is unecessary for installation, obtaining the sake source can be done in
several ways:
</p><ul>
<li> A tarball can be downloaded from <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/master-sake">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/master-sake</a>. Only the most stable releases
get uploaded to the Python Package Index, so this is a great option for users
that are looking for stability.
</li><li> A tarball or zip file of sake is available for download on this project&rsquo;s
webpage at <a href="http://tonyfischetti.github.io/sake/">http://tonyfischetti.github.io/sake/</a>. This is the latest snapshot of the
master branch of sake from its git repository, where it is developed. This
is the second-most stable version of the sake source. This is perhaps more
feature-rich than the source on PyPI, but it may contain bugs that would
hopefully be found and fixed before upload to PyPI.
</li><li> Finally, the bleeding-edge sake source can be cloned directly from the git
repository thusly: (assuming you have git installed)
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">    git clone https://github.com/tonyfischetti/sake.git
</pre></div>
</li></ul>
<p>For the vast majority of cases, the best way to obtain sake is during the
installation step, with the python package manager <code>pip</code>.
</p>
<a name="Dependencies"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.2 Dependencies</h3>
<p>There are four pieces of open source software that must be installed to
ensure the proper functioning of sake:
</p><ul>
<li> Python. Sake is dually compatible with Python 2 and 3 and is
tested using Python 2.7,  3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8
</li><li> The python module <code>NetworkX</code>
</li><li> The python module <code>PyYAML</code>
</li><li> The graph visualization tool <code>Graphviz</code>
</li></ul>
<p>Future versions of sake may shed some of these dependencies.
</p>
<a name="Generic-Installation-Instructions"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.3 Generic Installation Instructions</h3>
<p><strong>Note: performing all of these steps are usually unnecessary
depending on what system you are using. If you do not care to know how
sake can be installed generically, you should read the installation
instructions for your specific platform (if available) below.</strong>
</p>
<p>If you do not already have it, Python can be installed by following the
links on the Python.org website: <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">http://www.python.org/download/</a>. There are executable installers for
Windows and Mac OS X. There are also download links to the Python source
code for compiling on Unix and Unix-alike systems though, for these
systems, there is very often a package manager available that will
facilitate a much easier python installation process. If the
platform-specific instructions are not available below, a quick search
of the web for
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">&lt;your system here&gt; python install
</pre></div>
<p>can save you a lot of trouble.
</p>
<p>The two python packages and sake itself can be installed in at least two
ways.
</p><ul>
<li> One uses the python package manager <code>pip</code>. After <code>pip</code> is installed,
these python packages can be installed from the command-line thusly:
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">pip install master-sake
</pre></div>
<p><code>pip</code> installing <code>master-sake</code> should automatically install
dependencies <code>NetworkX</code> and <code>PyYAML</code>. If there is a problem
and it doesn&rsquo;t do this automatically, the dependencies can be easily
installed by issuing these commands:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">pip install networkx
pip install pyyaml
</pre></div>
<p><code>pip</code> itself can be installed via:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">easy_install pip
</pre></div>
<p>Finally, <code>easy_install</code> can be installed with instructions from
this website: <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools</a>
</p></li><li> Another way to install these python packages is by downloading a tarball
of the source of these packages, extracting the archive and running the
<code>setup.py</code> script inside the extracted archive with
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">python setup.py install
</pre></div>
</li></ul>

<p>Finally, Graphviz can be installed easily by following the directions
on the Graphviz download page: <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php">http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php</a>. Easy-to-install packages are
available for Mac OS X, Windows, GNU/Linux, and Solaris.
</p>
<a name="Installation-for-Mac-OS-X"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.4 Installation for Mac OS X</h3>
<p>Python and <code>easy_install</code> are already installed and ready to use on
OS X. Open <code>Terminal.app</code> (usually in /Applications/Utilities) and issue
the following commands:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install master-sake
</pre></div>
<p>The use of <code>sudo</code> will prompt you for your login password, if applicable.
</p>
<p>Finally, Mac-specific Graphviz installers are available at the Graphviz site
at <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/Download_macos.php">http://www.graphviz.org/Download_macos.php</a>. The Mountain Lion installer
will work with Mavericks and Yosemite.
</p>
<p>If you are using a version of Python that is not the version that ships
with OS X, you should follow the &rsquo;Generic Installation Instructions&rsquo;.
</p>
<a name="Installation-for-GNU_002fLinux-_0028Debian_0029"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.5 Installation for GNU/Linux (Debian)</h3>
<p>Debian and some Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions make it very easy to
install sake and all of its dependencies. Issue the following commands in a
terminal emulator:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sudo apt-get install python-networkx
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install master-sake
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>python-networkx</code> will automatically install PyYAML, and Graphviz.
</p>
<p>If for some strange reason, Python is missing on your Debian system, you can
install it using <code>apt-get</code>, as well.
</p>
<p>For other GNU/Linux distributions, check to see if your system has a
package management tool and whether these (or analogous) packages are
available for that tool. <code>yum</code> and <code>pacman</code> are some other
popular package managers, although there are many others.
</p>
<a name="Installation-on-Windows"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.6 Installation on Windows</h3>
<p><strong>Note: These instructions will assume that Python 2.7 is used. The
same installation instructions will work with Python 3.*, if the appropriate
version numbers are changed.
These installation instructions also assume the use of Windows 7. The
instructions should be the same, or very similar for other versions of
Windows</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li> Download the Windows Python installer at <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">http://www.python.org/download/</a>
</li><li> Double-click the installer. A default install will install Python in
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">C:\Python27\  or
C:\Python33\
</pre></div>
</li><li> Open the Control Panel. In the search bar, type
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">environment
</pre></div>
<p>and click on the entry that reads
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">Edit environment variables for your account
</pre></div>
</li><li> In the top-most list box, find the entry that reads <code>Path</code>. (If it
doesn&rsquo;t exist, you have to add it.) Click on
the <code>Edit...</code> button and append the following to the
<code>Variable value</code> field
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts
</pre></div>
<p>of course, changing the Python version number if necessary.
</p></li><li> Download the Python script that bootstraps <code>easy_install</code>
at
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py">https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py</a>
</pre></div>
<p>Place this file somewhere you can find with the command prompt. This will
assume you named it <code>ez_setup.py</code>.
</p></li><li> Open a command prompt window (Windows key + r, type &quot;cmd&quot;, press &lt;Enter&gt;)
</li><li> Navigate to the directory where ez_setup.py resides and run it with Python.
As an example,
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">cd C:\Users\me\Desktop
python ez_setup.py

</li><li> After the last command finishes, close the command prompt window, open
a new one, and issue the following commands:
<div class="example">

<h3 class="section">2.7 Updating sake</h3>
<p>If sake is installed using <code>pip</code>, updating is as easy as running
the following command:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">pip install --upgrade master-sake
</pre></div>
<p>If sake was installed through the tarball and
<code>python setup.py install</code>, you can just download the latest tarball
and run the installation command again.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Using Sake</h2>

<a name="Running-Sake"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.1 Running Sake</h3>
<p>Sake is a command-line tool. After proper installation, running sake is just
a matter of typing <code>sake</code> into your terminal. To see all the options,
you can type:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sake -h
</pre></div>

<p>Sake expects certain things of the directory you run it from. Without any
options, it looks for files called &quot;<code>Sakefile</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>Sakefile.yaml</code>&quot;,
&quot;<code>Sakefile.yml</code>&quot; (in that order) and uses the first one it finds. The
<code>Sakefile</code> is the instruction manual for building a project, and is the
subject of the next section. Almost all of the command-line flags and
arguments passed into the <code>sake</code> executable just modify how it treats and
interacts with the Sakefile instructions.
</p>
<p>After running <code>sake</code> for the first time, a file is deposited in the
current directory named &quot;<code>.shastore</code>&quot;. This hidden file is another YAML
document that stores the SHA1 hashes of all the dependencies and output files
indicated in the Sakefile. This is how sake determines which dependencies
have changed and what targets need to be rebuilt.
</p>
<a name="The-Sakefile"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.2 The Sakefile</h3>

<p>The sakefile, which serves as the instruction manual for sake builds, is 100%
parse-able YAML. The structure of the YAML document enforces simplicity and
readability.
</p>
<p>The Sakefile format as <code>sake</code> requires it, is a subset of the full YAML
specification. There are only a few structures that can appear in the
document:
</p><ul>
<li> targets
</li><li> meta-targets
</li><li> the &quot;all&quot; special target
</li><li> macro definitions
</li><li> an arbitrary number of comments
</li></ul>

<p>All valid Sakefiles must contain at least one target. All other elements are,
strictly speaking, optional.
</p>
<a name="Anatomy-of-a-target"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.3 Anatomy of a target</h3>
<p>The &quot;target&quot; is an isolated collection of key-value pairs that tells sake
how to build one element that makes up the whole project. Before we get into
the details of all the necessary components of a target, it would behoove
us to see a complete example of one:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">format raw data:
    help: format raw (copy and pasted) data using perl
    dependencies:
        - raw-data.txt
    formula: &gt;
        perl -pe 's/^(\D+)\s+([\d,]+)\s+([\d,]+)\s*/\1\t\2\t\3\n/'
        raw-data.txt | sed 's/,//g' &gt; cleaned-data.tsv;
    output:
        - cleaned-data.tsv
</pre></div>

<a name="Target-title"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.3.1 Target title</h4>
<p>The target names serve two purposes in sake projects.
</p><ul>
<li> If you are looking to build only one part of a project (which includes all of
that part&rsquo;s dependencies) the name of the target is the string you pass into
the <code>sake</code> executable to denote that.
</li><li> When sake produces a dependency diagram, the target name is the name of the
node in the visualization.
</li></ul>
<p>There are very few restrictions on what can be used as a valid target name.
The only requirements are
</p><ol>
<li> that the YAML parser used by sake unambiguiously identify the name as a string
</li><li> it is not named any of the following reserved names:
<ul>
<li> <code>help</code>
</li><li> <code>visual</code>
</li><li> <code>clean</code>, or
</li><li> <code>all</code>
</li></ul>
</li><li> it does not contain parentheses. Parentheticals in target names have
special meaning.
</li></ol>
<p>Since the target name can also serve as a
(very) short description of what the target is for, the target name should
aim to be descriptive. The target title in the example above is, or course,
<code>format raw data</code>.
</p>
<a name="Help"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.3.2 Help</h4>
<p>The <code>help</code> value in the target is an arbitrarily long description of
what the target is for. This is automatically parsed and output when the
<code>sake help</code> command is run.
</p>
<p>Since sake seeks to be a documentation tool, as well as an automated build
system, the <code>help</code> element is mandatory.
</p>
<a name="Dependencies-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.3.3 Dependencies</h4>
<p>The <code>dependencies</code> element is a list of all the files (by filename) that
are required for the target to build. In the example above, the target only
requires the input of file <code>raw-data.txt</code>, so that is the only
dependency. The filenames may be written as an absolute path, or as a relative
path. All relative paths are relative to the directory where <code>sake</code> is
run. So the dependency entry may have been written like
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">    - ./input/raw-data.txt
</pre></div>
<p>if it were stored in a directory under the current directory named
<code>input</code>, or
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">    - ../raw-data.txt
</pre></div>
<p>if it were in a directory above the current directory.
Even though you can specify a file above the current working directory, it
is strongly discouraged and runs contra to sake&rsquo;s aim for simplicity and
being intuitive. Ideally, the Sakefile should appear in the top level
directory of any given project and only reference files below it.
</p>
<p>A dependency entry may also contain Unix-style &rsquo;wildcard&rsquo; characters. For
example, a dependency that looks like this:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">    - ./input/*
</pre></div>
<p>will tell sake that the target described depends on all the files in the
directory named <code>input</code>. Even though sake supports the use of wildcards,
for most use cases, wildcard usage should be discouraged because it obscures
clarity and makes reading the Sakefile difficult.
</p>
<p>If a target has no dependencies, the dependency field may be left out. A good
example of this would be if there is a target that starts off a data pipeline
and just downloads a CSV from the internet.
</p>
<p>Sake determines which targets have to be run by whether any of its
dependencies&rsquo; content has changed. If a target has no dependencies,
<code>sake</code> has to assume that the target needs to be rebuilt every time it
is run. To stop this behavior, you can create a dummy dependency for the
target that never changes, or changes only when you want to explicitly
re-run the target. Alternatively, you can include the dependency field but
leave it blank, like so
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">    dependencies:
    formula: &gt;
    ....
</pre></div>
<p>This will also stop sake from running the target every time <code>sake</code> is
called.
</p>
<a name="Formula"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.3.4 Formula</h4>
<p>The <code>formula</code> field stores the command that carries out the building of
a target. It is a string that gets executed as a system command. Anything
that can be done in the shell from a terminal emulator can be used as a
target&rsquo;s formula. In this way, the formula is like an arbitrarily long
shell script. It can call other scripts, run programs, and send commands to
specific interpreters. You can even get fancy with Applescript, VBScript, or
Powershell and communicate with running applications or control menu-driven
interfaces.
</p>
<p>Remember that any scripts called from the formula should appear in the
dependency list, or the formula will not be rerun if the script changes.
</p>
<p>Every &quot;target-proper&quot; must have a formula. If a formula is missing from a
target, <code>sake</code> inteprets it as a meta-target, which is the subject of
a future section.
</p>
<a name="Output"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.3.5 Output</h4>
<p>This field is similar to the <code>dependency</code> field; it lists all of the
files that are created as a result of the target&rsquo;s formula being run. This
section serves three very important roles in sake:
</p><ol>
<li> It is used internally by sake to determine which targets have to be run and
updated before others. If another target uses the output from the above
target (namely, <code>cleaned-data.tsv</code>), that target needs to know that
if the dependency of the target whose output it relies on has changed, its
output has to be brought up to date in order for it&rsquo;s own output to be up to
date.
</li><li> It is recorded by sake so that when the <code>sake clean</code> command is run,
the output files are automatically removed from the project&rsquo;s file
structure.
</li><li> It provides useful information to someone (a human) reading the Sakefile so
they can tell where a file came from and why it&rsquo;s there.
</li></ol>
<p>As with the <code>dependencies</code> entries, output entries may contain wildcard
characters but, again, this may obscure clarity. It is also potentially
dangerous, as <code>sake clean</code> will remove files that match the wildcard
that may be unintended.
</p>
<a name="Ignored-attributes"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.3.6 Ignored attributes</h4>
<p>An arbitrary number of other key-value attributes may be added to a target&ndash;
sake will just ignore them. Even so, adding other attributes may be helpful
for other reasons... consider the following addendum to the example target
from above:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">format raw data:
    help: format raw (copy and pasted) data using perl
    WARNING: the regular expression need to be rewritten for readibility
    dependencies:
        - raw-data.txt
    formula: &gt;
        perl -pe 's/^(\D+)\s+([\d,]+)\s+([\d,]+)\s*/\1\t\2\t\3\n/'
        raw-data.txt | sed 's/,//g' &gt; cleaned-data.tsv;
    output:
        - cleaned-data.tsv
</pre></div>
<p>This added &quot;<code>WARNING</code>&quot; atrribute may contribute to the documentation
quality and improve understanding of the project.
</p>
<p>Added non-standard attributes may also be helpful components of a non-sake
tool that processes Sakefiles to perform some other function, such as
to generate markup.
</p>
<p>Sake will issue a warning if it sees an attribute name that it doesn&rsquo;t
recognize because it is possible that it was a mispelling of a reserved
attribute. If the warning is unwanted, it is possible to suppress it
by adding &quot;<code>(ignore)</code>&quot; in front of the attribute name, as in this example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">format raw data:
    help: format raw (copy and pasted) data using perl
    (ignore) WARNING: the regular expression need to be rewritten...
    ...
</pre></div>


<a name="Meta_002dtargets"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.4 Meta-targets</h3>
<p>Meta-targets allow one or more targets to be treated as one. This can greatly
improve readability and make a Sakefile more managable to maintain.
Here&rsquo;s an example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">foobar:
    help: does &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;
    foo:
        help: does &quot;foo&quot;
        dependencies:
            - baz.dat
            - foo.sed
        formula: &gt;
            ./foo.sed baz.dat &gt; foo.dat;
        output:
            - foo.dat
    bar:
        help: does &quot;bar&quot;
        dependencies:
            - baz.dat
            - bar.awk
        formula: &gt;
            ./bar.awk baz.dat &gt; bar.dat;
        output:
            - bar.dat
</pre></div>
<p>In this example, both atomic targets &quot;<code>foo</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>bar</code>&quot; use
shell scripts to transform the file &quot;<code>baz.dat</code>&quot; to &quot;<code>foo.dat</code>&quot; and
&quot;<code>bar.dat</code>&quot;, respectively. These targets are similar in function so it&rsquo;s
plausible that it would make sense to group them together, while also keeping
them functionally separated so that one may be run independently of the other.
</p>
<p>With a Sakefile containing the meta-target above, <code>sake</code> may be run on
<code>foobar</code>, <code>foo</code>, or <code>bar</code> as in this command:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sake foobar
</pre></div>

<p>This grouping can be readily seen in the output of the <code>sake help</code>
command:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">You can 'sake' one of the following...

foobar:
  - does &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;
    foo:
      -  does &quot;foo&quot;
    bar:
      -  does &quot;bar&quot;

clean:
  -  remove all targets' outputs and start from scratch

visual:
  -  output visual representation of project's dependencies
</pre></div>

<p>A meta-target must have a help field, and at least one target. A meta-target
may not contain another meta-target, either.
</p>

<a name="Macro-definitions"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.5 Macro definitions</h3>
<p>In addition to targets, a Sakefile may also contain &quot;macro definitions&quot;.
</p>
<p>A macro definition can be used to replace often-repeated paths and files
with shorter &quot;nick-names&quot; or aliases. More generally, it replaces text
elsewhere in the Sakefile document with the value specified in the macro
definition.
</p>
<p>To use a macro, you first have to define one, like in these examples:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">#! A_FILE=areallyreallyreallylongfilename.jpg
#! THE_PATH = /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/
#!LS = ls -al
</pre></div>
<p>The macro definition must start with &quot;<code>#!</code>&quot;. Then, the macro name must
start with a letter and contain no spaces. Then an equals sign (<code>=</code>),
and then the macro&rsquo;s value. Anything after the first non-whitespace character
after the equals sign and until the end of the line is considered to be part
of the macros value, including spaces (as with the &quot;<code>LS</code>&quot; example.)
</p>
<p>Any amount of spacing is allowed after the &quot;<code>#!</code>&quot; and preceding and
following the equals sign.
</p>
<p>The capitalization of the macro name is not a requirement but it improves
readibility by sending clear notice to the human Sakefile reader that a
macro is being used.
</p>
<p>To actually use a macro in a Sakefile, the macro name must be prefixed by
a dollar sign (&quot;<code>$</code>&quot;) as with this example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">formula: &gt;
    cp ./$A_FILE $THE_PATH
</pre></div>

<p>One thing to watch out for when using macros in Sakefiles is that it can only
be used in a string. This is because the dollar sign is a special character
in YAML and is only ignored when it is in what is, unambiguously, a string.
For this reason a macro cannot (and shouldn&rsquo;t be) used as a target name
unless it is quoted. It may be used anywhere in a formula, though, because
the formula is one large string.
</p>
<p>If the macro is meant to be included in a larger word, using curly braces
can improve readibility (and potentially reduce ambiguity). This example
depicts the use of curly braces when using macros:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">formula: &gt;
    cp ./$A_FILE ${THE_PATH}Frameworks
</pre></div>
<p>which copies the file <code>areallyreallyreallylongfilename.jpg</code> to the 
directory <code>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Frameworks</code>.
</p>
<p>If you want a literal dollar-sign (&quot;<code>$</code>&quot;) in the formula, you have to
use two dollar-signs (&quot;<code>$$</code>&quot;).
</p>
<a name="The-special-_0022all_0022-target"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.6 The special &quot;all&quot; target</h3>
<p>The last component that a Sakefile may contain is a special target, named
&quot;<code>all</code>&quot;, that is a list of targets to build when <code>sake</code> is run
with no other targets named.
</p>
<p>Normally, when the <code>sake</code> command is run and a target is not passed in
as a parameter, sake will build <em>all</em> of the targets in the Sakefile. If
there is an &quot;all&quot; target specified, though, <code>sake</code> will only build the
targets that &quot;all&quot; names. This can be helpful to prevent certain targets
from running all the time, or if <code>sake</code> is run while a target is
actively being written.
</p>

<a name="Building-a-project"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.7 Building a project</h3>
<p>To properly cover the topic of building a sake project, an example of a
full example Sakefile would be helpful for reference, and to help put
everything in context:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">---
# Macros

            - convert.sh
        formula: &gt;
            ./convert.sh;

            perl -pe 's/^(\D+)\s+([\d,]+)\s+([\d,]+)\s*/\1\t\2\t\3\n/'
            rawdata.txt | sed 's/,//g' &gt; duistats.tsv;
        output:
            - duistats.tsv

find correlates:
    help: &gt;

        - teenstats.csv
        - dui-correlates.R
    formula: &gt;
        ./dui-correlates.R
    output:
        - Rplots.pdf
        - lmcoeffs.txt
...
</pre></div>

<p>A short description of each of the steps appears in the &quot;help&quot; field on
each entry. Basically, there are two source data files: one exists as raw
text (copy and pasted from a website), and the other is fetched from the web
using <code>curl</code>. The former is cleaned and formatted using <code>perl</code> and
<code>sed</code>; the latter has to go through a process that converts downloaded
excel file into a CSV and strips useless lines. Both of these source data
files then get read by an R script which, ultimately, outputs a corrogram
graphic and a summarization table.
</p>
<p>The problem occurs when the file &quot;<code>rawdata.txt</code>&quot; is changed or updated,
perhaps by another team member. One of two things can happen:
</p><ul>
<li> The maintainer of the project can remain wholly unaware of the change to
&quot;<code>rawdata.txt</code>&quot; and carry around &quot;<code>Rplots.pdf</code>&quot; and
&quot;<code>lmcoeffs.txt</code>&quot; thinking that they are the most up-to-date reflection
of the data available.
</li><li> The maintainer knows that the file has changed and has to either re-run
all of the steps in the workflow, or dig into zer memory and remember that
&quot;<code>fetch teen stats</code>&quot; needn&rsquo;t be re-run, but that
&quot;<code>format dui stats</code>&quot; <em>and</em> &quot;<code>find correlates</code>&quot; have to be
re-run, and in that order.
</li></ul>

<p>Admittedly, this is not a very complex workflow and is fairly easy to grasp
all at once. But imagine if the workflow involved hundreds of files, with
intricate inter-connectivity; it is unreasonable to expect that someone can
keep track of which components have to be updated. The only recourse
available is to re-run <em>all</em> the components. In modern science and
data analysis, this can easily take hours or days.
</p>
<p>Like stated in the introduction, sake seeks to solve this problem by keeping
track of the dependency structure for you. After the first build, any
subsequent call to <code>sake</code> will only result in the building of the
components reliant on changed files.
</p>
<p>The first time the Sakefile above is run, the output looks like this:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ sake -q
Running target format dui stats
Running target fetch teen stats
Running target convert teen stats to csv
Running target find correlates
Done
</pre></div>
<p>(we used the &quot;<code>-q</code>&quot; flag to cut down on the volume of the output for
this example)
</p>
<p>If <code>sake</code> is called again, the output looks like this:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ sake -q
Running target fetch teen stats
Done
</pre></div>
<p>Sake knows that no dependencies have changed, and that the only target that
needs to run again is &quot;<code>fetch teen stats</code>&quot; (because it has no
dependencies).
Had the excel file that <code>fetch teen stats</code> downloads from the net been
modified in any way, sake would detect this and re-run the appropriate
targets, and <em>only</em> those targets. If the change to
&quot;<code>teenstats.xls</code>&quot; was trivial and had no bearing on the output
&quot;<code>teenstats.csv</code>&quot;, sake would be smart enough to know not to re-run
<code>find correlates</code> because it would not change.
</p>
<a name="Building-specific-parts-of-a-project"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.7.1 Building specific parts of a project</h4>
<p>There are two ways to tell <code>sake</code> to build only certain parts of a
project:
</p><ol>
<li> Add an &quot;<code>all</code>&quot; target that lists only the targets that you wish
to build.
</li><li> Supply the name of the target you&rsquo;d like to build to <code>sake</code> as a
parameter. You can see of full list of the targets you can build with
the <code>sake help</code> command. If you have spaces in your target name, be
sure to put the target name in quotes so the shell doesn&rsquo;t interpret the
words as separate arguments, like
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">sake &quot;find correlates&quot;
</pre></div>
</li></ol>

<p>It is important to note that even if they haven&rsquo;t been named, sake will
<em>not</em> ignore targets if they are dependencies of the target that was
asked to be built. Only the targets that don&rsquo;t have anything to do with the
target that was asked to be built will be ignored.
</p>
<p>In some project configurations, if a specific target is named, sake will
require that another target/targets run as well. This occurs when two
targets share dependencies and building one without the other will
break project integrity.
</p>
<a name="Debugging-a-Sakefile"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.7.2 Debugging a Sakefile</h4>
<p>When writing and testing any Sakefile for a project of sufficient complexity,
you may come across problems. If it isn&rsquo;t a bug in sake, it may be helpful
to diagnose the problem by running sake in verbose mode. This will list all
the steps that sake took to execute and explain reasoning for running certain
targets and not running others.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>sake -v</code>
</pre></div>

<p>Verbose mode&rsquo;s logical inverse is &quot;quiet mode&quot; which lists only the targets
that are being built as they are executed. With this option, the commands in
the formulas, and the output of those commands are suppressed.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that errors are never suppressed, even in quiet mode.

<a name="Choosing-from-different-Sakefiles"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.7.3 Choosing from different Sakefiles</h4>
<p>In certain circumstances, it may be helpful for a project to have more than
one Sakefile, perhaps with instructions for building on different platforms.
As stated above, <code>sake</code> will look for a file called &quot;<code>Sakefile</code>&quot;,
&quot;<code>Sakefile.yaml</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>Sakefile.yml</code>&quot; (in that order) and uses the
first one it finds. You can force <code>sake</code> to use a specific Sakfile
thusly:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sake -s yoursakefile
</pre></div>
<p>The extention need not be &quot;.yaml&quot; or &quot;.yml&quot; in order for <code>sake</code> to
accept it.
</p>

<a name="Parallel-building"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.8 Parallel building</h3>
<p>If two different targets are not dependencies of each other (one does not
depend on the other, and vice-versa) that means the two targets can be built
simultaneously. On modern computers with multi-core processors, this usually
means that the two targets will build on two separate cores. This means that
building the two targets will only take as long as the building of the target
that takes the longest to complete.
</p>
<p>Consider a <code>sake</code> project consisting of  two targets with no
interdependencies and the targets take the same amount of time to build.
If the project is built in <code>parallel</code> mode, you can expect the time to
build the whole project to be cut roughly in half. Similarly, on a machine
with 8-cores, and in a project with 8 independent (non-interdependent)
targets whose build times are identical, you can expect a parallel project
build time of 1/8th of the time it would take to build the project serially
(non-parallel).
</p>
<p>In real-world projects, the targets are rarely all independent, but running
a project in parallel mode may drastically decrease total build-time anyway.
</p>
<p>Using <code>sake</code>&rsquo;s parallel mode is very easy; all you have to do is supply
the <code>-p</code> flag to <code>sake</code> on the command-line. <code>Sake</code> will
automatically determine which targets can be run in parallel and do so.
</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, consider this sakefile that builds a four-line
poem line-by-line. Each line takes two seconds to output to an intermediate
file. After all of the lines are outputted to files, the one-line files are
combined in order to product <code>poem.txt</code> which contains the whole poem...
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">line by line:
    help: print each line of the poem to a file
    first line:
        help: prints the first line
        dependencies:
        formula: &gt;
            sleep 5;
            echo Twinkle twinkle little bat &gt; first.txt;
        output:
            - first.txt

    second line:
        help: prints the second line
        formula: &gt;
            sleep 5;
            echo How I wonder what youre at &gt; second.txt
        output:
            - second.txt

    third line:
        help: prints the third line
        formula: &gt;
            sleep 5;
            echo Up above the world you fly &gt; third.txt
        output:
            - third.txt

    fourth line:
        help: prints the fourth line
        formula: &gt;
            sleep 5;
            echo Like a tea tray in the sky &gt; fourth.txt
        output:
            - fourth.txt

combine them:
    help: combine all the lines
    dependencies: 
        - first.txt
        - second.txt
        - third.txt
        - fourth.txt
    formula: &gt;
        cat first.txt second.txt third.txt fourth.txt &gt; poem.txt;
    output:
        - poem.txt
</pre></div>

<p>Building this project by just issuing the <code>sake</code> command takes 20.24
seconds on my machine. This is because each target (taking 5 seconds) is run
one after another. If the project is build in parallel mode, however...
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">sake -p
</pre></div>

<p>it takes only 5.24 seconds to build.
</p>
<p>The example project above is a bit of an unatural example that was only
constructed for pedagogical purposes; it was purposely designed to benefit
greatly from parallel building. Nevertheless, in many real-world
projects, using parallel mode can save an enormous amount of time.
</p>


<a name="Other-Options"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.9 Other Options</h3>

<a name="g_t_0022Recon_0022-mode"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.9.1 &quot;Recon&quot; mode</h4>
<p>When coming back to building a project after changing a few files,
particularly if it is a large project, it can also be helpful to know which
targets sake will build/rebuild (and in what order) <em>before</em> you actually
build them. This can be helpful for planning purposes as well as for
debugging.
</p>
<p>Sake allows you to do just this with <code>recon</code> mode. To use it, just supply
the <code>-r</code> argument to the sake command. Instead of executing the commands
in each target&rsquo;s formula, it will just print the name of the targets it
<em>would</em> build. For example, after running <code>sake clean</code> on the
Sakefile introduced in the previous section, running sake in recon mode will
look like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"># <strong>sake -r</strong>
Would run target: third line
Would run target: fourth line
Would run target: first line
Would run target: second line
Would run target: combine them
</pre></div>

<p>You can also combine parallel mode and recon mode to learn how sake will
approach the parallel building:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"># <strong>sake -r -p</strong>
Would run targets 'second line, first line, fourth line, third line' in parallel
Would run target 'combine them'
</pre></div>

<p>In a project that has already been built before, after changing a couple of
files, <code>recon</code> mode can be an invaluable tool to investigate the impact
of your changes. 
</p>
<p>You should be aware that recon mode cannot <em>a priori</em> tell all the
changes that will happen down the road, though. For example, if <code>recon</code>
mode indicates that a certain target will be re-run, if that target will
change any output files that are dependencies of other targets, sake cannot
know that and recon mode will not detect it.
</p>
<a name="Forcing-building"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.9.2 Forcing building</h4>
<p>If <code>sake</code> doesn&rsquo;t build a target, it is because none of its dependencies
have changed. However, if you want <code>sake</code> to rebuild the target anyway,
the best way to do this is to use <code>force</code> mode by supplying the
<code>-F</code> command-line flag. This can be applied to just one target (or
meta-target) or the whole project. If <code>force</code> mode is used to rebuild
the whole project, it is roughly equivalent to running <code>sake clean</code>
and then <code>sake</code> again.
</p>
<a name="Colored-output"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.9.3 Colored output</h4>
<p>You can get <code>sake</code> to output success messages in green, warnings in
yellow, and errors in red by supplying <code>sake</code> with the <code>-c</code> flag:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"># sake -c
</pre></div>

<a name="Enhanced-formula-error-handling"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.9.4 Enhanced formula error handling</h4>

<p>A potential Sake &quot;gotcha&quot; in previous versions: if you had several commands
in your <code>formula</code> separated by semicolons or literal new-lines,
it was possible for one of the earlier commands to fail and for Sake to
still think the command succeeded.  Specifically, if the last command in a
formula was successful, it&rsquo;d appear to Sake as if the whole formula succeeded.
This (usually) unsavory behavior could be thwarted (in some shells) by 
separating the commands not by semicolons (or literal new-lines) but with
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>s:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">command_1 &amp;&amp; command_2
</pre></div>

<p>Doing this, the shell will only execute the second command if the first one
returned a non-zero exit status.
</p>
<p>Because terminating a series of commands in a formula at the first sign of
error is such a common need&ndash;and because having Sake recognize any failed
command as an &quot;unsuccessful&quot; formula build is usually very important&ndash;recent
versions (starting at version 0.9.7) by default use a mode called
&quot;enhanced errors&quot; (which, unfortunately, only works for POSIX (non-windows)
systems. What this does is add the <code>-e</code> option to the shell that
<code>sake</code> executes it&rsquo;s formulas in.
</p>
<p>This behavior can be turned off by using the <code>-E</code> option:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"># sake -E
</pre></div>

<a name="Custom-shells"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.9.5 Custom shells</h4>
<p>By default, Python chooses the shell that will run your formulas. On Windows,
it will chose <code>cmd.exe</code> and on POSIX systems, it will run the POSIX shell
(<code>/bin/sh</code>. If you have constructs in your formulas (named pipes,
subprocess redirection, etc...) that requires another shell, you can specify
the alternative shell to use in your Sakefile:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">shell: bash
</pre></div>



<a name="Visualization"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.10 Visualization</h3>
<p>The last basic topic to cover is sake&rsquo;s visualization capabilities.
</p>
<p>Since sake already knows which targets are dependent on others (and why), it
was a small jump to enlist the help of the powerful graph visualization
software, Graphviz, to be able to visualize these dependency structures.
</p>
<p>With Graphviz properly installed, creating a visualization of your workflow
is as easy as running the command
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sake visual
</pre></div>
<p>This will, by default, deposit a file called &quot;<code>dependencies.svg</code>&quot; into
your current working directory. This file can then be opened (and printed)
from an image viewer or a web browser. The SVG file format is a good choice
for graph visualizations because it can be scaled arbitrarily large without
pixelation.
</p>
<p>Internally, the visualization feature follows these steps:
</p><ol>
<li> The dependency graph that sake stores internally is written to a
temporary text file, in a format that Graphviz understands.
</li><li> The Graphviz executable (called &quot;<code>dot</code>&quot;) is called to convert the
text file that describes the graph into a image.
</li><li> The temporary file is deleted.
</li></ol>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to name the resulting visualization something other than
&quot;dependencies.svg&quot;, you can call <code>sake visual</code> with the <code>-f</code> flag:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sake visual -f anothername
</pre></div>
<p>This will name the file &quot;<code>anothername.svg</code>&quot; (the file extention is
automatically appended).
</p>
<p>If another image format is desired, specify a filename with the <code>-f</code>
flag and include a file extension. For example, to get a jpeg representation
of the dependency network, use:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sake visual -f somename.jpg
</pre></div>
<p>Sake can handle the following file extentions and image formats:
.svg, .jpg (or .jpeg), .png, .gif, .ps, .pdf
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>The Sakefile in the example above will yield a visualization like this:
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="deps.png" alt="deps">
</div>
<br>

<h2 class="chapter">4 Advanced Sake Usage</h2>

<a name="Using-Patterns"></a>
<h3 class="section">4.1 Using Patterns</h3>
<p>Sake may have a strong preference for elegance and simplicity, but that
doesn&rsquo;t mean Sake is lacking advanced features. One such feature is
&rsquo;formula patterns&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Very often in project building, the same procedure has to be performed
on many similar files. Formula patterns allow you to condense all of the
targets down to one that gets automatically autoexpanded. If you find
yourself with targets that have identical formulas except for a file
that changes from target to target, this might be a perfect application
for formula patterns.
</p>
<p>Concretely, it is a common C programming/compilation idiom to compile all
C files in a directory into object files (which then get linked together).
If there are four such .c files (file1.c, file2.c file3.c, and file4.c)
in a directory that all need to be object-compiled, you certainly
<em>can</em> create four different targets to perform this, but you can
also employ formula patterns here.
</p>
<p>If the original Sakefile snippet looked like this:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">compile C file1:
    help: compiles C file 1
    dependencies:
        - &quot;file1.c&quot;
    formula: &gt;
        gcc -c -o file1.o file1.c
    output:
        - file1.o

compile C file2:
    help: compiles C file 2
    ....
</pre></div>

<p>the new target to replace the four targets above will look like:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">compile %cfiles:
    help: compiles file %cfiles into object file
    dependencies:
        - &quot;%cfiles.c&quot;
    formula: &gt;
        gcc -c -o %cfiles.o %cfiles.c
    output:
        - &quot;%cfiles&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>This may appear as but one target in the Sakefile, but as far as Sake is
concerned, these are four different targets (or how ever many files the
pattern matches&ndash;it was just four in our example).
</p>
<p>To prove it, <code>sake help</code> will yield:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">&quot;compile file1&quot;:
  - compiles file file1 into object file

&quot;compile file2&quot;:
  - compiles file file2 into object file
...
</pre></div>

<p>Additionally, since these are separate targets, <code>sake visual</code> will
render them separately, and parallel sake will run them in parallel, if
applicable.
</p>
<p>Note that anywhere in the target the string &quot;<code>%cfiles</code>&quot; is used, the
substitution is of the base name of the file, and not the file extentions.
</p>
<p>For another example, say you have to convert all png images in a directory
to jpeg files; you have a program called &quot;picconvert&quot; that performes the
conversion. The Sakefile snippet will look a little like this:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">convert %picfile:
    dependencies:
        - &quot;%picfile.png&quot;
    formula: &gt;
        picconvert --from png --to jpg %picfile.png %picfile.jpg
    output:
        - &quot;%picfile.jpg&quot;
</pre></div>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> The percent-sign (&quot;%&quot;) is not a valid character in YAML
unless it is in a string. Because Sakefiles are 100% valid YAML, you need
to make sure that <code>sake</code> categorically recognizes attributes/values
with a percent-sign in them as strings. You can make sure that this
happens by wrapping them in quotation marks. Quoting the target name, help
string, or formula is usually unecessary, but it is usually necessary to
quote the &rsquo;dependencies&rsquo; item and &rsquo;output&rsquo; item.
</p>
<p>When using patterns in your Sakefiles, there are four other things to keep
in mind
</p><ol>
<li> The pattern must appear in the dependency field.
</li><li> A target that has a pattern in the dependency must have the pattern in the
target name. Because Sake treats every file match as a new target, and
different targets cannot share a name, the pattern must be in the target name
to get outexpanded and keep the target names different and specific.
</li><li> A target using a pattern must use the pattern in its formula. 
</li><li> A target using a pattern must have an output, and must use the pattern
in the output
</li></ol>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be worried about this requirements; It is hard to think of a
legitimate usage of formula patterns that will violate any of the rules above.
</p>
<a name="Using-Includes"></a>
<h3 class="section">4.2 Using Includes</h3>
<p>Another one of Sake&rsquo;s advanced features is called &quot;includes&quot;.
</p>
<p>Includes are a lot like storing macros in a different file and then
importing those macro definitions into your Sakefile.
</p>
<p>The primary use case for this feature would be to use the same Sakefile
across different architectures/platforms but be able to substitute
values for platform dependent variables.
</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say a C project decides to support the two most
popular open source C compilers, clang and gcc. It would be silly to write
two different Sakefiles&ndash;one that uses gcc for compilation, and one that uses
clang for compilation&ndash;and switch which Sakefile you use dependending on
the machine being used.
</p>
<p>Instead, a program can be run to interrogate a system, find the name of the
extant/preferred C compiler, and drop that into a yaml file as a Sake
compatible macro. That very macro can then be included in the Sakefile.
</p>
<p>Concretely, let&rsquo;s say a configure script is run and it determines that gcc is
the preferred C compiler. It can then create a file called <code>config.yaml</code>
with the following content:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">#! C_Compiler=gcc
</pre></div>

<p>In the Sakefile, we can include a line like this:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">#&lt; config.yaml
</pre></div>
<p>This will make the <code>C_Compiler</code> macro available for use in the Sakefile.
(Note that &quot;<code>config.yaml</code>&quot; could have been named anything.)
</p>
<p>If you include a non-existent config file, <code>sake</code> will throw a fatal
error. There may be a use case, however, where you would like to include a
macro definition file, but don&rsquo;t want to strictly <em>require</em> it. In this
case, you can label the include file <code>optional</code>, as in this line:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">#&lt; filetoinclude.yaml optional
</pre></div>

<p>It is also possible to raise a warning when an optional include file is
missing; the user will see this warning everytime <code>sake</code> is run until
the include file becomes existent. This can be done thusly:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">#&lt; filetoinclude.yaml or warning: include file missing
</pre></div>
<p>Everything after the &quot;<code>or</code>&quot; will be considered the warning message.
</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The yaml file that you include is always relative to the
top-level project directory. That means that you can include a file in a
subdirectory of a project&rsquo;s root by specifying the path relative to
that root. It also means that in a project with two or more Sakefiles&ndash;
where one is in a subdirectory of the project&rsquo;s root&ndash;if the one in the 
subdirectory includes a file &quot;config.yaml&quot;, it will look for that
file relative to the project&rsquo;s root, <strong>not</strong> in the subdirectory
that houses the Sakefile that actually included the file.
</p>
<a name="Advanced-Use-of-Macros"></a>
<h3 class="section">4.3 Advanced Use of Macros</h3>
<p>Similar to how having macro include files is useful in some settings,
so too is it helpful to be able to supply macro definitions on the
command-line. For example consider the following <em>complete</em> Sakefile:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">compile hello:
    help: compiles &quot;hello&quot;
    dependencies:
        - hello.c
    formula:
        $CC -o hello $CFLAGS hello.c
    output:
        - hello
</pre></div>

<p>Note how the macros <code>CC</code> and <code>CFLAGS</code> are not specified by the
Sakefile. If you use Sake to build this, the <code>$CC</code> and <code>CFLAGS</code>
will not be replaced and will go into the formula, verbatim. If CC and
CFLAGS are not environment variables in your shell, then the formula will
fail.
</p>
<p>To specify values for these macros (so that Sake can expand them
appropriately) run <code>sake</code> using one or more <code>-D</code> key/values.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"># sake -D CC=gcc -D CFLAGS=&quot;-Wall -Werror&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>You can provide default values for these macros by putting this at the
top of the Sakefile displayed above:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#! CC?=clang
#! CFLAGS?=-Wall -Werror
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>?=</code> construct basically says &quot;if this macro is not defined, set
it to this&quot;. If you don&rsquo;t include the question mark before the equals sign,
the macro definitions on the command line (via <code>-D</code>) will <em>not</em>
override it.
</p>
<p>To require that a macro be pre-defined, either via the command-line
<code>-D</code> option or in an include file, you can use the <code>or</code> option:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#! CC or Have to specify a C compiler
</pre></div>

<p>Everything after the &quot;<code>or</code>&quot; will be considered the error message
to be printed.
